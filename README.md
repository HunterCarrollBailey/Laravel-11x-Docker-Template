# Docker-izing Laravel
-- -
This repo is mainly to hold the template for me to Docker-ize any of my laravel applications. Simply copy the laravel application to the src directory, set up the env file in /src , and run `./local.sh start` from the root directory. 

This has all the required services such as Nginx, MariaDB (MySQL), Redis, PHPMyAdmin, and MailHog. Its easy to expand upon, and should run smoothely.
